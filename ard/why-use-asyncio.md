I'll explain why using asyncio with aiohttp is generally more performant than using the regular requests library for downloading files:

1. **Asynchronous I/O Operations**:
   - When downloading files, there are two main types of operations:
     - Network I/O (waiting for data from the server)
     - Disk I/O (writing data to the file)
   - With synchronous code (like `requests`), your program blocks (waits) while waiting for these I/O operations to complete
   - With asyncio, while waiting for I/O operations, your program can perform other tasks

2. **Chunked Downloads**:
   - In the code, we see:
   ```python:script.py
   async for chunk in response.content.iter_chunked(32768):  # 32KB chunks
       f.write(chunk)
   ```
   - This allows for streaming the download in chunks
   - With asyncio, while one chunk is being written to disk, the next chunk can already be downloading
   - The regular `requests` library would block for each operation sequentially

3. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Asyncio uses an event loop to manage multiple I/O operations
   - Instead of creating multiple threads (which can be resource-intensive), asyncio uses coroutines
   - This is especially beneficial when you need to:
     - Download multiple files simultaneously
     - Handle multiple concurrent connections
     - Manage other I/O operations while downloading

4. **Memory Usage**:
   - The chunked download approach with asyncio prevents loading the entire file into memory
   - Each chunk (32KB in this case) is processed independently
   - This is particularly important for large files

However, it's worth noting that for simple, single-file downloads where you don't need concurrent operations, the performance difference might be negligible. The benefits of asyncio become more apparent when:
- Downloading multiple files simultaneously
- Handling multiple network requests
- Managing complex I/O operations
- Working with large files that need to be processed in chunks

If you're interested in seeing the actual performance difference, you could try implementing both versions and comparing their performance with different file sizes and concurrent download scenarios.
